This documents the quirks of running the FastX 2 client on the
machines I sit at: rick (work desktop), layerpro (work laptop), mack2
(home desktop), gazorpazorp (home laptop).

The main trouble/issue is the FastX 2 client 1) uses a built-in SSH
client, and 2) always uses the available SSH agent.  The latter causes
problems, as you'll see below.  Also, I switch between rick/mack2 a
lot, so those systems are generally running in parallel.  And,
finally, I use SSH agents at home and work, only one of which uses
agent forwarding (work).  The goal is to minimize the number of
ssh-agent processes.  I don't forward my agent from home to work, for
the obvious reasons.

Another wrinkle is I forward connects from home to work via a machine
at home that I do not sit at.  That ssh runs in a screen.

So, why all these words?  Because sometimes connecting my FastX client
from home to work hangs.  When that happens, this is the fix, which is
sufficiently complex that I need to refer to it from time to time:

* Make sure no FastX instances are running at home.

* Run FastX from the Dock and connect to work.  If this hangs, then:
    - exit all FastX instances
    - restart tunnel to work
    - try again
  Still broken?
    - kill all the ssh-agent processes at work
    - restart tunnel -- this should start a new agent at work and ask
      to add my default key
    - try again

NOTE: at home, I run two instances of FastX.  The instance for work
doesn't use my home agent.  The instance for home uses my home agent,
and for this reason it needs to be run from BASH with the `fastx`
alias.
