# bink - a personal collection of BASH scripts

_bink_ is a collection of scripts that I share between work and
home.  I hope you enjoy them.

| **Script**    | **Description** |
| :------------ | :-------------- |
| diffdirs      | diff two directories, but not their contents |
| knock         | knock but no more than needed |
| m             | mail result of executing command to an email address |
| macosx_tweaks | automate change various Mac OS X settings |
| mount_smb     | BSD/MacOSX: mount an SMB share over an SSH tunnel |
| sleepcontrol* | MacOSX: scripts for controlling sleep behavior |
| wake-host     | use ether-way to wake a host |
| bash_sshagent | [automatic SSH agent handling for BASH](bash_sshagent.md) |
| bash_prompt   | fancy prompt for BASH |

For more detailed information on the scripts, see the source for the
script.  I recommend that you not run the script without examining it
first.
