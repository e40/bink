# bink - a personal collection of scripts

_bink_ is a collection of scripts that I share between work and
home.  I hope you enjoy them and find them useful.  I've tried to give
attribution for scripts and ideas I found on the intertubes.
Stackoverflow gets lots of thanks.

| :------------ | :-------------- |
| bash_prompt   | [a utilitarian BASH prompt](bash_prompt.md) |
| bash_sshagent | [automatic SSH agent handling for BASH](bash_sshagent.md) |
| diffdirs      | diff two directories, but not their contents |
| knock         | knock but no more than needed |
| install_agent_wrapper.sh | SSH agent wrapper for Dock-started apps |
| m             | mail result of executing command to an email address |

script.  I recommend that you not run the script without examining and
understanding it first.
