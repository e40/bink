# bink - a personal collection of BASH scripts

_bink_ is a collection of scripts that I share between work and
home.  I hope you enjoy them.

| **Script**    | **Description** |
| :------------ | :-------------- |
| knock         | knock but no more than needed |
| m             | mail result of evaluating args to an email address |
| macosx_tweaks | automate change various Mac OS X settings |
| mount_smb     | BSD/MacOSX: mount an SMB share over an SSH tunnel |
| sleepcontrol* | MacOSX: scripts for controlling sleep behavior |

For more detailed information on the scripts, see the source for the
script.  I recommend that you not run the script without examining it
first.
