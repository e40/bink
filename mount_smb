Usage: mount_smb [--verbose] [--debug]

                 [--sshconfig config]

On Mac OS X, mount an SMB share via an SSH tunnel.  It uses autossh
to ensure the connection stays open, even in the face of sleeping a laptop
or interrupted network connections.

The script pauses in the middle to let you use the volume,
then when you continue it dismounts and shuts down the tunnel.

It uses "sudo" so you either need to supply the password or add to
/etc/sudoers for password-less operation.

Multiple instances of this script can run at a time, since each one
uses a new, local device and maps local ports 139 and 445 for that
device to the remote machine.

/etc/sudoers changes for password-less operation are below, which 
should be added with the "visudo" command as root:
   Defaults        env_keep += "AUTOSSH_PIDFILE"
   $USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ifconfig lo0 *
   $USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: $bindir/autossh
   $USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: $bindir/ssh
   $USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: $removepidfile ${pidfileprefix}*

The above assumes that $bindir/ssh is used in preference to
/usr/bin/ssh.  If that is not the case, then update which binary is allowed
by sudo.

This script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.9.

Optional arguments:
 --verbose              :: print informative messages, with date stamps
 --debug                :: aid in debugging; certain timeouts are smaller
 --user remote-user     :: defaults to \$USER
 --no-finder-open       :: do not open a Finder window, post mount
 --sshconfig config     :: defaults to \$HOME/.ssh/config
 --sshidentity identity :: defaults to \$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa

Required arguments:
 --sshhost sshhost        :: the SSH host, or the other end of the tunnel
 --smbhost smbhost        :: the SMB host, which is accessible to the SSH host.
                             The SMB host can be different than the SSH host.
 --workgroup workgroup    :: the SMB workgroup
 --share name[,name2,...] :: the SMB share to mount -- if multiple names
                             are given mount each one for the given smbhost

You can initialize the following command line arguments from
the script \$HOME/.mount_smb.  The command line to variable name mapping
is:
   --sshconfig      sshconfig
   --sshidentity    sshidentity
   --user           remoteuser
   --sshhost        sshhost
   --smbhost        smbhost
   --share          share
   --workgroup      workgroup
   --no-finder-open noopen
   --verbose        verbose
   --debug          debug

Optional BASH function hooks for \$HOME/.mount_smb:

mount_smb_usersetup
  If defined, it is called before the autossh is initiated, so any
  setup required for ssh to the remote host can be done, such as
  knocking.

mount_smb_autossh_failed
  If defined, it is called after autossh fails to establish a
  connection to the remote host.  It can be used, for example,
  to forcibly knock.

mount_smb_timer
  If defined, it is called every 10 minutes (every minute if --debug
  is given) post-mount with these arguments:

    mount_smb_timer \$minutes_since_mount

  It can be used to open network access after a set period of time elapses,
  for example.

mount_smb_post_mount
  If defined, it is called post-mount, with arguments these arguments:

    mount_smb_post_mount "\$mountpoint" "\$smbhost" "\$share"

  It can be used to do post-mount things, like displaying a particular
  share with the Finder.  For example:

  # When mounting share "john" on host "linuxhost", open the "incoming"
  # subdirectory in the Finder.
  function mount_smb_post_mount {
      local mountpoint=\${1-}
      local smbhost=\${2-}
      local share=\${3-}
      case "\$smbhost" in
	  linuxhost) [ "\$share" = "john" ] && open \$mountpoint/incoming ;;
      esac
  }

All of the above hooks are optional and are undefined unless defined by
the user.
